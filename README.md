# code-quest

Hello!

To start the quest create PR to this repository which adds a new line in this README.md with the text Hello world:

Hello world

Looks good! Now let's make a Go program that will print this line for us every time we run it. Please create a PR with program code, other files if necessary and update instructions on how to run the program below:

To start the program run:
```go run main.go```
