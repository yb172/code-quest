# code-quest

Hello!

To start the quest create PR to this repository which adds a new line in this `README.md` with the text `Hello world`:

Hello world

Looks good! Now let's make a Go program that will print this line for us every time we run it. Please create a PR with program code, other files if necessary and update instructions on how to run the program below:

To start the program run:

```
go run main.go
```

If you want to change World Size, add flag `world-size` to the start command

```
go run main.go --world-size=20
```
