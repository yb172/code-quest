This is a quick documentation on `How to Start Playing This Game`, sooner I will add a Dockerfile for this thing so it will be easier to deal with in the future, but not it is not hard to do this tasks ( below this paragraph )

```
cd cmd
go run main.go
```

If you want to change World Size, add flag `world-size` to the start command

```
go run main.go --world-size=20
```

And if you want to change Depth, add flag `depth` to the start command

```
go run main.go --depth=10
```
